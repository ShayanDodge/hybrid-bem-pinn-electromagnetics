This repository contains implementations of a coupled **Boundary Element Method (BEM)** and **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** framework for solving the **Laplace equation** on L-shaped domains.

The project is organized into versioned implementations, progressing from a baseline model to more advanced physical configurations.

<td width="55%" valign="top">

### 🔹 v1.0.0 — Homogeneous L-Shaped Domain  
**Folder:** `Homogeneous L-Shaped Domain (V1.0.0)`

- Baseline implementation of the BEM-PINN framework  
- Solves the Laplace equation on a homogeneous L-shaped domain  
- Domain decomposition:
  - Left subdomain → solved using PINN  
  - Right-bottom subdomain → solved using BEM  
- Coupling enforced through interface boundary conditions  

👉 This version establishes the core methodology and validates the approach.

## 🧠 Method Overview

The general workflow across versions:

1. Construct the L-shaped computational domain  
2. Define Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions  
3. Train a PINN on one subdomain  
4. Use PINN predictions at the interface  
5. Solve the complementary subdomain using BEM  
6. Reconstruct the global solution

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open MATLAB  
2. Navigate to a version folder (e.g., `V1.0.0`)  
3. Run the main script inside the `main/` directory  

Example command:

run_bem_pinn_laplace_lshape

## 📊 Output

Each version produces:

- Scalar potential field  
- Gradient fields  
- BEM reconstruction  
- Combined contour visualization
