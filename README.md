## 🔗 Official Implementation

This repository is the **official implementation** of the paper:

> **“A Novel Hybrid Boundary Element—Physics Informed Neural Network Method for Numerical Solutions in Electromagnetics”**  
> Published in IEEE Access, 2024  
> https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755077  

It provides a hybrid computational framework that combines the **Boundary Element Method (BEM)** and **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for solving electromagnetic problems governed by the **Laplace equation**.

The repository reproduces and extends the methodology proposed in the paper, including domain decomposition and coupling via interface boundary conditions.

## 🧠 Overview

This work introduces a **hybrid BEM–PINN approach** for numerical solutions in electromagnetics:

- **PINN** is used to solve the PDE in part of the domain  
- **BEM** is applied to the remaining subdomain  
- The two methods are **coupled through interface conditions**  

This approach leverages:
- the flexibility of neural networks  
- the efficiency of boundary-based numerical methods  

to solve partial differential equations in complex domains.
