<tr>
<td width="55%" valign="top">

### 🔹 v1.0.0 — Homogeneous L-Shaped Domain  
**Folder:** `Homogeneous L-Shaped Domain (V1.0.0)`

- Baseline implementation of the BEM-PINN framework  
- Solves the Laplace equation on a homogeneous L-shaped domain  
- Domain decomposition:
  - Left subdomain → solved using PINN  
  - Right-bottom subdomain → solved using BEM  
- Coupling enforced through interface boundary conditions  

👉 This version establishes the core methodology and validates the approach.
